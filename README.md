## Task 1 - GrabCut

Selected image: dog on a chair\
Object of interest: the whole chair

### Steps

1. Draw a mask in Photopea.\
![Mask](data/mask.png)\
The red area marks possible foreground, the whie area marks sure foreground, and the black area marks sure background.

2. Load mask with OpenCV and convert it to a mask with values `cv2.GC_BGD` (black), `cv2.GC_FGD` (gray), and `cv2.GC_PR_FGD` (white) for sure background, sure foreground, and possible foreground, respectively.\

3. Use the mask to initialize the GrabCut algorithm with 5 iterations. The result is shown below.\

4. Mark sure foreground and possible foreground as sure foreground. The result is shown below in comparison with the ground truth.\

5. Apply the mask to the original image. The result is shown below.\

6. Compute DICE coefficient. The resulting similarity is 96.73%.

## Task 2 - Semi-supervised Segmentation
